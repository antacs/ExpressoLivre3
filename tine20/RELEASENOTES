-----------------

1. VCard import in addressbook

- It is now possible to import vcards into the addressbook and the plugin is usable in the import framework (js client + CLI)
- We use the vcardphp class by Frank Hellwig (http://vcardphp.sourceforge.net) to parse the file 
and the import plugin by Yann Le Moigne <segfaultmaker@gmail.com>


2. API change Tinebase_Backend_Sql / Tinebase_Backend_Sql_Abstract
-----------------

- The constructor API has changed: all options have moved to one options param
    public function __construct($_dbAdapter = NULL, $_options = array())
- you can use the following options:
     *  - modelName
     *  - tableName
     *  - tablePrefix
     *  - modlogActive
     *  - useSubselectForCount
     
 3. Move to GIT
-----------------
 
 - The Sourcecode-Management-System changed from Subversion to GIT.
 - Several subprojects got their own repositories
 - http://git.tine20.org/git/
 - The main reasons for this change are the fast and reliable branching and merging capabilities of GIT. 
 With this, we hope to reach an even higher level of development productivity.
 
 
 4. js/css description and build via jsbuilder2/jsb2tk
----------------- 
- js/css Files to be included are not longer to be defined in Appname/Fontend/Http.php
- js/css Files to be included are now defined in Appname.jsb2
- The name of the standard Tine 2.0 fat client is FAT a appname package has to be named Appname-FAT
- compression and inclusion is done by the jsb2tk lib (library/jsb2tk)

5. Move to Phing
-----------------
- release.php got deleted and replaced with a phing build.xml
- see http://www.phing.info/trac/
- a js/css build is done by just typeing phing in the tine20 root dir
